We attempted to identify patterns in different sectors of the stock market when a presidental party changes from Democrat to Republican or Republican to Democrat. We also looked at if there were patterns in different months throughout the year-- if it is better to buy a stock during January or April. Future, we broked down stocks into different sectors to determine if some sectors (such as healthcare or basic industries) did better with one party whereas some do better with other parties. We did not find any patterns that were strong enough to dictate a succesful trading algorithm. Results were not statistically significant.
